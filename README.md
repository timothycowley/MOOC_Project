# SHOOT FOR THE MOOC
### database project

This is a database class team project. The Team and I are really passionate about education. We wanted to come up with solutions to get more high school students involved in STEM. We decided to focus with programing since we are programmers ourselves and because this field is in high demand. Many high schools currently offer programing classes, but impoverished schools often lack the budget and expertise for such programs. 

We felt that these schools don't need to invent their own programs because free massive open online courses are already available for computer science. Our idea was to create a database with web interface for searching for free beginning to intermediate level computer science courses. Though self motivated students could take such courses on their own, the school system can help by exposing the students to the courses and offering gathering places for the students to study together (or even create a formal class around it). Local tech companies can assist by providing volunteer tutors or instructors. For this purpose we also created databases for partnering schools, classes, volunteers, and registered students.  

While a lot of other things need to be done to initiate such a program, we only focus on the databases and the queries we would need. Anything beyond that would be outside the scope of the database course objectives. 

This is something we would really like to see happen, but we are far too busy to work on it at this time. If anyone likes this idea and wants to run with it feel free to take the idea and to use any of the code provided here.

It should be noted that this was my first group CS project. I was new to both SQL and Java at the time. The code works and demonstrates reasonable competance in SQL and Java and an understanding of relational databases, but has much room for improvement. 

None of the SQL tables are provided. You would need to construct these yourself. 


### Note

If you are a recruiter or hiring manager reading this as a sample of my coding ability and/or knowledge of databases, I recommend you look at the Medicare project instead. However the Medicare project uses a non-relational database (Cassandra), so this is the only work on GitHub showing my knowledge of SQL and relational databases.
